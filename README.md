# subscriber_churn_demo



- ### What is the Problem We Are Addressing?
  - Over-the-top services or OTT is a category of media solutions that are in the form of apps that are distributed via mobile, tablet or TV (e.g., Netflix). The lines that traditionally separated players in the media segment are rapidly blurring. Streaming services (OTT most prominently), TV companies, and social networks are now competing over the same audiences. Radio stations, podcast companies, and streaming services are competing to provide radio and podcast content.
  - As consumers get overwhelmed by the number of options, they will look to purge their subscriptions. Increased competition means media companies have to focus on content, user experience and loyalty, to create a more direct and lasting relationship with consumers.

- ### What Are Organizations Doing Today?
  - No matter the type of subscription business Organizations are a part of it is increasingly important to understand your subscribers to assist the business in spending marketing budget wisely, increasing revenue and reducing churn. In fact, Deloitte predicts [Streaming Services will see $150 million cancellations next year](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/streaming-services-churn-2022-deloitte-1235055461/)
  - Whether leveraging [recommendation algorithm's and e-mail reminders](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/netflix-customer-service-and-churn-rate) to keep subscribers entertained or providing discounts and promotions to cancellation risks it is imperative for organizations to limit their churn in order to stay alive as competition grows.
  - Today, subscription businesses like Netflix are prioritizing content to attract users but this is costly and we are seeing a shift in cost sensitivities amongst consumers. According to [Deloitte in 2020](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/video-streaming-services-churn-rate.html), the number of US consumers subscribing to at least one free ad-supported service grew considerably, from 40% in January to 60% by October. 
  
- ### What Are Important Data & Analytic Considerations Today?
  - First Party Subscriber data can only take your organization so far when conducting subscriber analysis. To fully understand your subscriber, it is required you explore other 3rd party data sources that can provide additional details ranging from demographics to location data.
  - Churn analysis is a valuable tool for any subscription business, but it needs to be deployed in the proper context. It’s one thing to know that you have a X percent churn rate. However unless you understand which subscribers are cancelling, why they're cancelling, when they’re cancelling, etc., it is nearly impossible to derive any data driven decisions from it.
  - Understanding your Customer's Lifetime Value (CLV) is an important metric as it costs less to keep existing customers than it does to acquire new ones, so increasing the value of your existing customers is a great way to drive growth.

- ### What Does this Demo Aim to Solve?
  Based on customer subscription pattern, determine customer churn.

  This demo is aimed at building dbt [python models](https://deploy-preview-1754--docs-getdbt-com.netlify.app/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/python-models) with Snowflake.
